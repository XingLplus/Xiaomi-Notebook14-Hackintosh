## Introduction

This repo contains information for getting macOS working on a **Xiaomi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition** laptop.

This is intended to create a "fully" functional (as far as possible) hackintosh for the Xiaomi Notebook 14.
If you would like to get started with creating a hackintosh on your laptop but have non experience, I would highly recommend following [**Dortania's OpenCore Install guide**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) and then returning here for troubleshooting.
With each new release of macOS we need to resolve each new "minor issue" we run into. The installation is not perfect yet since it's a continuos work-in-progress, but I'm glad to say that **I learned a lot** in the meantime. All of the steps I made to get to this point were a result of countless hours of reading along with trial and error. I am by no means an expert so any help to get this project functional is very appreciated!

 If internet is not working at installation then create [offline installer](https://github.com/doesprintfwork/All-in-one-Vanilla-AMD-Hackintosh-Guide/blob/master/offline-installer-guide/offline-part-2/windows.md).

 For privacy reasons, all SMBIOS information has been wiped out in the configuration file `EFI/OC/config.plist`. [Generate your own SMBIOS Information](#generate-your-own-smbios-information)

 You can follow this guide to install MacOS In your Mi Notebook 14 [YouTude Guide For Installing](https://youtu.be/4LgyTZQ3jfQ)

<summary>What's not working: incompatible Hardware</summary>

- [ ] **Discrete graphics card** (NVIDIA GeForce MX150) is not working, since macOS doesn't support Optimus technology
  - Have used `SSDT-DDGPU.aml` to disable it in order to save power.
- [ ] **Fingerprint sensor** is not working
  - Fingerprint readers on Macbooks are managed by T2 chip which has not been very throughly reverse engineered yet
    - Have used `SSDT-XHC.aml` to disable it (in order to save some power).

## Generate your own SMBIOS Information

For privacy reasons, all SMBIOS information has been wiped out in the configuration file `EFI/OC/config.plist`. You need to generate your unique `SMBIOS` info by yourself (recommend to use [**CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS**](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)), and inject them into your `config.plist`.

- With every **EFI update** you retrieve from [release page](https://github.com/uttusharma/Xiaomi-Notebook14-Hackintosh/releases), please, remember to transfer your Device details under `PlatformInfo -> Generic` in your `config.plist`.

## Improvements/Post-Install

<details>
<summary><strong>Enable Tap (with one finger) for Touchpad</strong></summary>
<br>

Starting from [VoodooI2C v. 2.4.1](https://github.com/VoodooI2C/VoodooI2C/releases), the **click down** action is emulated to **force touch**, which causes the failure of click down and drag gestures.

For example, you can turn off `Force Click` in `System Preferences -> Trackpad` or choose three finger drag in `System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Mouse & Trackpad -> Trackpad Options`

Suggested configuration:

## FAQ

### My touchpad isn't working after update.

You need to rebuild the kext cache after every system update. Use `Kext Utility.app` or type `sudo kextcache -i /` in `Terminal.app`. Then restart. If this still doesn't work, try to press F9.

### I can't click to drag files using the trackpad

Starts from [VoodooI2C v2.4.1](https://github.com/alexandred/VoodooI2C/releases/tag/2.4.1), the click down action is emulated to force touch, which causes the failure of click down and drag gestures. You can turn off `Force Click` in `SysPref - Trackpad` or choose `three finger drag` in `SysPref - Accessibility - Mouse & Trackpad - Trackpad Options`.

### My screen turns to black and has no response during the updating process

If you have black screen for five minutes and get no response from the device, please force restart your laptop(Long press power button) and choose `Boot macOS Install from ~` entry.- [Xiaomi Notebook 14 Hackintosh]
